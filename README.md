# WRO-G15 Project

We are a group of students who developed this project for the WRO G15 category (World Robot Olympiad 2025).  
Our goal was to design and build a robot that can move inside the arena, detect obstacles, and complete tasks on its own.  
It was a learning journey for us where we tried, failed, fixed, and improved step by step until we reached an almost finished robot.

## What we did
- First, we set up the arena and planned how the robot should move.  
- Then we built the chassis and started wiring all the components.  
- We tested the robot many times, each attempt helped us understand what to change.  
- At the end, we had a working prototype that could navigate and avoid obstacles.

## Key Features
- ESP32 microcontroller for fast and responsive control  
- Ultrasonic sensors for measuring distance and detecting obstacles  
- Servo steering system for smooth and flexible movement  
- Autonomous obstacle avoidance with minimal delay  
- Open-source hardware and software design so it can be improved and learned from  

## Tech details
The robot is programmed in **C++** and runs on the **ESP32 platform**.  
We used the **Arduino IDE** with the Arduino core for ESP32 to write and upload our code.  
Our focus was to make the system both educational and functional, and we gained real experience in robotics, embedded systems, and IoT applications.

## Photos
We kept photos of our progress (see the `images/` folder), including:  
- Arena setup  
- Chassis building and wiring  
- Assembly stages  
- Almost finished robot  
## Demo Videos
We also recorded short videos to showcase the robot:  
- [Robot Showcase 1](media/videos/robot_showcase1.mp4)  
- [Robot Showcase 2](media/videos/robot_showcase2.mp4)
